## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned(and struggled with)

- How to setup and utilize Tailwind CSS
- How to work with Tailwind Config file to adding global attributes
- Structuring Code for clarity
- Dom Manipulation
- Managing visibility of components
- Troubleshooting in the Console
- Following a Design-Given Project




### Continued development

I will continue my knowledge in web development, and playing around with DOM Manipulation, and ideally grasp more knowledge in frameworks like React. I really enjoyed utilizing Tailwind CSS, and I will continue to implement this into future project.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) - Tailwind CSS documentation is extremely useful and the interface for documentation is AWESOME!

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank **Frontend Mentor** for providing the challenge! This was a great way to dive into DOM Manipulation and I enjoyd the learning process. Of course, I always utilize ChatGPT as a tool, and I utilized this tool to reinforce learning along the way. Specifically, for understanding Tailwind and working with things like Event listeners and Class/ID selectors.
